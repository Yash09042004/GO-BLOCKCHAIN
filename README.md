# GO-BLOCKCHAIN
Implementing Blockchain in Golang on the Concept of Proof Of Work.
Implemented the core blockchain structure and functionality, including the creation and validation of new blocks.
Developed a Proof of Work algorithm that iteratively hashes new blocks until a hash meeting the difficulty criteria is found. This process ensures the computational difficulty and security of adding new blocks to the chain.
Utilized Go's powerful concurrency features to optimize the Proof of Work process.
Ensured the integrity of the blockchain by validating that each new block's hash is a hash of the previous block.
